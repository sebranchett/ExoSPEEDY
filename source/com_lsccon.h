C--:  /LSCCON/: Constants for large-scale condendation (initial. in INPHYS)
C--:   TRLSC  = Relaxation time (in hours) for specific humidity 
C--:   RHLSC  = Maximum relative humidity threshold (at sigma=1)
C--:   DRHLSC = Vertical range of relative humidity threshold
C--:   RHBLSC = Relative humidity threshold for boundary layer
